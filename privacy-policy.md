# 🛡️ SecuriScanX – Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** December 2025

SecuriScanX (“the Extension”) is a browser extension developed to help users identify potential client-side vulnerability risks such as SQL Injection (SQLi), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Command Injection (CMDi) on the currently active webpage. This Privacy Policy explains what information the Extension collects, how it is used, and how your data is protected.

---

## 🔹 1. Information We Collect

SecuriScanX is designed with privacy in mind.  
**The Extension does NOT collect, store, transmit, or sell any personal data.**

Specifically:

- ❌ No personal information (name, email, address)  
- ❌ No browsing history  
- ❌ No authentication data  
- ❌ No IP or location data  
- ❌ No form submissions  
- ❌ No website content outside of the page you manually scan  
- ❌ No tracking or analytics  

The Extension operates entirely on your device.

---

## 🔹 2. Data Stored Locally

The Extension may store the following **only within your browser** using `chrome.storage.local`:

- Scan history  
- Scan results displayed to you  
- User preferences (e.g., theme or UI settings)  

This data:

- Stays on your device  
- Never leaves your browser  
- Is not shared with any server  
- Can be cleared at any time by uninstalling the extension or clearing extension data  

No data is transmitted to any external systems or third parties.

---

## 🔹 3. How the Extension Works

SecuriScanX performs scans **only when you manually click “Start Scan.”**

When triggered:

- The extension temporarily analyzes the input fields on the active tab  
- It injects safe, predefined test payloads  
- The results are displayed to the user  
- Nothing is stored or uploaded outside your local device  

The extension does **not** run continuous background scans.

---

## 🔹 4. Permissions Justification

SecuriScanX requests only the permissions required to perform its single function:

- **activeTab** — allows scanning only the tab you manually choose  
- **scripting** — injects scanning scripts on user request  
- **storage** — stores scan results locally  
- **host permissions** — required to test vulnerabilities on any user-selected site  

The extension never uses these permissions for tracking, monitoring, or data extraction.

## 🔹 5. Third-Party Sharing

SecuriScanX:

- ❌ Does NOT sell data  
- ❌ Does NOT share data with advertisers  
- ❌ Does NOT send data to remote servers  
- ❌ Does NOT integrate third-party analytics  

---

## 🔹 6. Children’s Privacy

SecuriScanX does not target or collect information from children.  
The extension is a technical tool intended for developers and cybersecurity learners.

---

## 🔹 7. Security

Because the extension does not handle personal data or generate network transmissions, the privacy risk is minimal. All functionality occurs locally within the browser.

---

## 🔹 8. Changes to This Policy

If this Privacy Policy changes in the future, the updated version will be posted on the official GitHub repository for SecuriScanX.
